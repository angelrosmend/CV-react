                <p>Since I was a child I've had a deep passion for music and
                    painting, being activities I still do nowadays in my free time.
                    As a Front-end developer, I enjoy using painting knowledge like
                    color theory to easily create layout designs, which are intuitive
                    and likable for the users.</p>
